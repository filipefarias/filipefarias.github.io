                Hi there,
            </p>
            <p>
                I've started my career as a programmer in <strong>2013</strong>. I'm graduated in industrial automation, so I started as a PLC and industrial robots programmer. In my first job, which help me to be the professional I am today, I had an environment very focused on <strong>excellence</strong> and code <strong>efficiency</strong>.
                In my <strong>10 years</strong> as a programmer, I worked a little over <strong>2 years</strong> as a maintenance technician for a giant multinational, where I learned to work with methods and teams, and improved my <strong>problem-solving</strong> skills.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Back to the programming area, I developed more and more curiosity for other programming languages.
                In <strong>2022</strong>, I started my studies focusing on web development, learning front-end and back-end technologies.
                I am currently working on some personal projects to compose my portfolio.
                This page is one of those projects. Feel free to browse it and learn more about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nice to meet you,
            </p>
            <p>
